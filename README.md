# arduinoRhythm
A Rhythm game on a Circuit Playground Express Arduino. The LED lights on left and right count down. When the lights reach the front, that's when you press the button corresponding with the lights. The left and right work independently of each other. If the lights count down yellow, you need to shout into the arduino instead of pressing the button.
